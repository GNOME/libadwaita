libhandy (0.0.13) amber-phone; urgency=medium

  [ Alexander Mikhaylenko ]
  * paginator-box: Stop using gtk_widget_set_child_visible()
    This function is meant for widgets that don't need to be mapped along with
    parent widget, not for scrolled out widgets. Additionally, using it causes
    strange side effects with GtkOverlay window z-ordering. Stop using it and
    instead track visiblity manually. Also, clarify the code a bit.
  * leaflet: Correctly handle 0 duration for swipe snap-back
  * swipe-tracker: Don't animate when the distance is 0.
    Usually it makes sense to restrict the minimum animation duration. However,
    if the progress already matches the end progress, it just causes a delay,
    so skip it completely.

  [ Julian Sparber ]
  * Keypad: Do not show allow typing + when only_digits is true.
    The keypad shouldn't allow typing or show + when only_digits
    is set to true. Therefore this adds the correct behavior.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * Release libhandy 0.0.13

 -- Guido Günther <agx@sigxcpu.org>  Fri, 27 Dec 2019 12:22:18 +0100

libhandy (0.0.12) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Zander Brown ]
  * build: Don't install glade catalogue when used as submodule

  [ Alexander Mikhaylenko ]
  * swipe-tracker: Grab widget during the gesture
  * swipe-tracker: Animate when canceled.
    There are some cases where not animating the canceled gesture looks
    awkward. For example, when tapping a paginator while it animates.
  * swipe-tracker: Don't add GDK_ALL_EVENTS_MASK.
    That was a debugging leftover.
  * header-group: Fix a leftover GtkSizeGroup mention
  * paginator: Delegate hdy_paginator_scroll_to() to scroll_to_full()
    This will help to avoid duplicating code in later commits.
  * paginator-box: Add hdy_paginator_box_get_nth_child()
  * doc: Add 0.0.12 index
  * Add HdySwipeable.
    A common interface that swipeable widgets should implement and that
    HdySwipeGroup and HdySwipeTracker will use.
  * paginator: Implement HdySwipeable
  * swipe-tracker: Port to HdySwipeable.
    Use a HdySwipeable instead of GtkWidget. Remove 'begin', 'update' and 'end'
    signals and instead call HdySwipeable methods.
  * Add HdySwipeGroup.
    An object that allows to synchronize swipe animations of multiple widgets.
    This can be used to sync widgets between headerbar and window content area.
  * tests: Add HdySwipeGroup test
  * glade: Support HdySwipeGroup.
    Do the same thing as for HdyHeaderGroup.
  * leaflet: Fix the folding sliding children padding.
    Sets the children padding of the folding sliding animation depending on
    the surface they'll be drawn on.
    This doesn't change a thing for the sliding animation, but this will
    avoid the children to be moved when snapshotting them, which is needed
    for the over and under animations — which will be added in the next
    commit — to work correctly.
  * leaflet: Only clip visible area during transitions.
    Adjust width and height of the clip rectangle to avoid drawing areas
    outside of the widget.
  * Introduce HdyShadowHelper.
    This will be used in the following commits to add shadows to HeyLeaflet
    transitions.
  * leaflet: Dim bottom children during transitions.
    Draw a dimming layer and a drop shadow over bottom child during 'over' and
    'under' mode and child transitions.
    The dimming, shadow and border styles are defined in CSS. The current style
    is based on the similar animation in WebKit.
  * swipe-tracker: Reduce base distance for vertical swipes.
    Use 300px instead of 400px, otherwise it can be hard to use on small
    touchpads.
  * paginator-box: Adjust index when removing pages.
    Prevent jumping when removing pages to the left of the current one.
  * paginator: Support discrete scrolling.
    Support scrolling on devices like mice. Switch a page when a scroll event
    arrives and add a delay to prevent too fast scrolling.
    Use animation duration as a delay, but don't let it go below 250ms, mainly
    to ensure it still works with animations disabled.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/155
  * swipe-tracker: Stop handling trackpoint.
    Handle it like discrete scrolling instead.
  * leaflet: Mention replacements in deprecations.
    Have more useful warnings.
  * leaflet: Mark child-transition and mode-transition as deprecated.
    Properties are deprecated too, not just accessors.
  * leaflet: Ignore deprecations for transition type acccessor declarations.
    Since enums are deprecated now, these declarations trigger warnings in
    modules that use libhandy. Since these functions are already deprecated
    anyway, silence these warnings.
  * deprecation-macros: Stop referencing nonexistent macros.
    G_DEPRECATED_* and G_DEPRECATED_*_FOR aren't a thing.
  * swipe-tracker: Make dragging touch-only.
    Since HdyPaginator has mouse scrolling now, there's no need to have
    dragging available on non-touch devices, so drop it.
  * paginator-box: Wrap children into child info structs.
    This will allow to carry additional data for them later.
  * paginator-box: Put children into their own GdkWindows.
    This allows to stop doing size allocation on each frame, and will allow
    to implement drawing cache in the next commit.
  * paginator-box: Implement drawing cache.
    Keep a Cairo surface for each child. Paint children onto their surfaces,
    then compose the final image. Instead of painting the whole children,
    track invalidations and paint only changed parts. This means most paginator
    redraws don't involve any child redraws. This should significantly speed
    up scrolling when children are expensive to draw.
  * paginator-box: Add animation-stopped signal.
    This will be used in the next commit to add page-changed signal to
    HdyPaginator.
  * paginator: Add page-changed signal.
    Allows to know when the current page has changed, this can be used to
    implement "infinite scrolling" by connecting to this signal and amending
    the pages.
  * leaflet: Allocate last visible child during child transitions.
    Fixes one cause of https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/85
  * keypad: Immediately assign g_autoptrs to NULL.
    Avoid compile-time warnings.
  * paginator-box: Create window with correct dimensions.
    It doesn't matter because it gets overridden later, but still fix it.
  * example: Remove leftover adjustments.
    See aa7a4eca68d8c75ff6347202c90515c5aea30c64
  * paginator-box: Fix hdy_paginator_box_get_nth_child()
    Return the actual widget, not child info struct.
    A leftover from 710bcaacb97bdfac6061726a77665235279d4fe6
  * leaflet: Use provided duration for child transitions.
    Actually use the value from the function argument.
  * swipeable: Provide swipe direction when preparing.
    This will allow to restrict the swipe to only one direction for leaflet.
  * swipeable: Distinguish direct and indirect swipes.
    Add "direct" parameter to hdy_paginator_begin_swipe() and the corresponding
    vfunc, providing a way to tell apart swipes started via HdySwipeGroup sync.
    This will be used to have leaflet in headerbar that's not swipeable, but
    can still animate along with leaflet in content area.
  * swipe-tracker: Skip swipes in wrong direction.
    Prevent swiping if the direction doesn't match tracker orientation. This
    allows to have GtkScrolledArea inside or around swipeable widgets without
    swipes taking over scrolling.
  * leaflet: Add allow-visible child property.
    This will be used to prevent swiping to widgets such as separators.
  * leaflet: Add properties for controlling swipes.
    This will allow to selectively enable back and/or forward swipes for
    HdyLeaflet. By default swipes are disabled.
  * leaflet: Implement back/forward swipe gesture.
    Implement HdySwipeable and use HdySwipeTracker to detect back/forward
    swipes.
    Use can-swipe-back and can-swipe-forward properties for controlling swipes,
    and use allow-visible child property to exclude certain widgets, such as
    separators, from the gesture.
    Multiple leaflets can be synced via HdySwipeGroup.
  * example: Enable back swipe in the leaflet.
    Set can-swipe-back=true on the content leaflet, allow-visible=false for
    separators and use HdySwipeGroup for syncing leaflets rather than binding
    visible child name.
  * leaflet: Queue relayout after child transition ends.
    Prevents close button from occasionally disappearing after swipes.
  * swipe-tracker: Add 'allow-mouse-drag' property
  * paginator: Add 'allow-mouse-drag' property.
    Usually we don't want this, because there's scrolling. However, phosh
    still needs this for lockscreen, hence optionally allow it.
  * paginator-box: Register window before setting parent.
    Prevents newly created widgets from reusing parent's window.
    Fixes a regression from e6a477492de6cc4d5107147b9724980ffd7343ea
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/165
  * swipeable: Fix signal names for docs
  * swipe-group: Don't escape tag names for docs
  * leaflet: Deprecate old transition type properties.
    They did already have the deprecated flag, but weren't shown as deprecated
    in docs.
  * Update @See_also for swipeable widgets.
    Mention HdyLeaflet in HdySwipeable, HdySwipeGroup and HdySwipeTracker.

  [ louib ]
  * Fix typo in README.
  * Remove casts requiring increased alignment.
    Some casts were increasing the required alignment in
    callbacks, raising warnings when compiled on arm with gcc.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * Add deprecation macros.
    The macros are libhandy internal (should not be used in application
    code) and are as such marked with a '_'. This also makes gtk-doc
    happy since it treats it as a public symbol otherwise.
  * Deprecate all hdy-dialer{-cycle}-button api.
    It's considered HdyDialer internal API
  * HdyDialer: Remove excessive '*'
  * build: Install new header file.
    Fixes: ac94e649aac540c1ecaa9df98364049e182605cc
  * Release libhandy 0.0.12

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * leaflet: Clip children when drawing unfolded.
    This will clip children to ensure they don't get drawn on or under the
    visible child, which will allow to create mode transition animations
    where other children appear to be drawn under the visible child.
  * leaflet: Clip the end surface when drawing folded.
    This will clip the end surface to ensure it doesn't get drawn on or
    under the visible child, which will allow to create mode transition
    animations where other children appear to be drawn under the visible
    child.
  * leaflet: Add the over and under mode transition animations.
    This allows the mode transition animation to match the semantic of the
    over and under child transitions.
  * leaflet: Unify the transition types.
    Add the HdyLeafletTransitionType enumeration and the transition-type
    property to define both the mode and child transitions, as having them
    different makes no sense and could lead to spatialization issues.
    This new type doesn't offer a crossfade transition on purpose as it was
    deemed inappropriate for the leaflet, for which the position of the
    children is inherently important.
    This also deprecates the two previous properties and their respective
    types.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/92.
  * leaflet: Remove the over and under mode transitions.
    There is no point in adding enum values and deprecating them in the same
    version, so let's just remove them. The animations are still available
    via the newly added HdyLeafletTransitionType type and the
    transition-type property, so this also encourages migrating to the new
    API.
  * examples: Add a Leaflet page.
    This adds a page to demo the leaflet transitions, drops usage of the
    deprecated leaflet transition types and properties, and defaults to the
    'over' transition to demo it and its shadow effect.
  * Deprecate HdyArrows.
    As far as we know, nothing uses it anymore and it's not part of our
    latest designs.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/126.
  * examples: Drop the Arrows page.
    HdyArrows is now deprecated, so we don't want to promote it.
  * leaflet: Drop some old TODOs.
    We just don't need them anymore.
  * leaflet: Add Alexander Mikhaylenko's copyright.
    His work on this class is far from negligeable, let's reflect that in
    the copyright.
  * view-switcher-button: Fix the action bar hover style.
    This makes the buttons out of a header bar slightly lighter when hovered
    and the window is focused. Previously they were the same color as the
    unfocused buttons and the action bar, making them look less good and
    harder to use.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/147.

  [ Julian Sparber ]
  * Keypad: Add a general keypad.
    This is based on HdyDialer, but with more flexible API.
    The new Keypad allows to set a custom Widget to the left/right
    lower corner, replacing the original widget.
    The Keypad extents directly GtkGrid which exposes all grid properties.
    It also allows to replace/change every button in the Keypad, just like
    in GtkGrid.
    It also adds a GtkEntry which can be used as the focus widget,
    it has the key-press-event already connected and it grabs focus once
    it's mapped. The Entry isn't part of the keypad, it's just a
    convenienced way to create a Entry, you would expect to use with a
    keypad.
  * Tests: add keypad tests
  * Docs: add docs and demo for keypad
  * Dialer: deprecate hdydialer
  * HdyDialer: Remove it from the demo.
    Remove the dialer from the demo since it's deprecated.
  * HdyDialer: Deprecate objects related to dialer.
    HdyDialerButton, HdyDialerCycleButton and HdyDialer objects where not
    deprecated, only there methods were.

  [ Oliver Galvin ]
  * README: minor punctuation fixes, and update Fractal URL to GNOME namespace
  * docs: Consistently use full sentences in short descriptions.
  * docs: Add sections about building and bundling to the 'Compiling with
    libhandy' page, and generally tidy the page.   * docs: Update copyright
    year range.
  * meson: fix configure-time warning - Use the 'pie' kwarg instead of passing
    '-fpie' manually. Also bump Meson to 0.49.0, when the pie kwarg was added.
  * meson: Tidy build files. Use / operator (added in Meson 0.49.0) instead of
    join_paths. Use package_api_name variable to avoid repetition.
  * style: Remove odd tabs as per 'Coding Style' in HACKING.md, and fix typo.

  [ Ting-Wei Lan ]
  * keypad: Fix compilation error for clang.
    Function hdy_keypad_button_get_digit is declared to return 'char' in
    src/hdy-keypad-button-private.h but defined to return 'const char' in
    src/hdy-keypad-button.c. This is not allowed by clang. Since it is
    unusual to mark a return value itself as const, just drop const here.

libhandy (0.0.11) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * dialer: Work around GtkGrid row homogeneity.
    Puts the buttons into a vertical size group rather than making the rows
    homogeneous. This prevents a bug from GtkGrid to make the buttons too
    tall when the action buttons are hidden.
  * dialog: Don't warn if the titlebar isn't a GtkHeaderBar.
    Using another widget is perfectly valid, so we should just return
    instead.
  * dialog: Refactor the transient-for workaround.
    This will make introducing new properties simpler.
  * dialog: Add the narrow property.
  * header-bar: Show a back button in a narrow HdyDialog.
    If a header bar is in a narrow HdyDialog, it will display a back button
    at its start in place of its usual window decorations.
  * examples: Add a complex HdyDialog example.
    This shows how to use HdyHeaderBar and HdyDialog to create a more
    complex adaptive dialog.
  * header-bar: Show a back button on small non-sovereign windows.
    This will show the back button not only in small HdyDialog but in all
    small windows that are not sovereign.
  * meson: Set the log domain.
    This makes the log messages from libhandy look like `Handy-Debug: …`
    rather than `** Debug: …`, making them easier to distinguish.
  * README.md: Update the documentation URL.
    It's on the developer.puri.sm now.
  * Add animation helpers.
    Add various animation helpers to avoid coyping them around.
  * squeezer: Support animation disablement.
    This will animate the child transitions only if animations are enabled.
  * preferences-group: Use the h4 style class.
    Use the h4 style class instead of hardcoding the bold style for the
    preferences group title, and implement a fallback making the font bold.
    This is needed by elementary to use their own style.
  * animation: Make some functions public.
    This makes hdy_get_enable_animations() and hdy_ease_out_cubic() public.
  * view-switcher-button: Don't make transparent on hover.
    This doesn't make the background transparent when hovering and apply the
    same style as non-hovered buttons on hovered buttons in a headerbar.

libhandy (0.0.10) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * .editorconfig: Add CSS
  * arrows: Refresh HdyArrowsDirection docs.
    This moves the HdyArrowsDirection documentation to the C file and
    removes the final period from the values definitions, like for all other
    enums documentations.
  * docs: Add section for new symbols in 0.0.10
  * view-switcher: Fix stack children callbacks.
    This fixes the callbacks when a child is added or removed from the view
    switcher's stack.
  * view-switcher-button: Make an active button's label bold.
    This makes the view switcher easier to read.
    It uses multiple labels with or without the specific style rather than a
    single label with the style toggled on and off to ensure the size
    requests don't change depending on whether the button is active or not.
  * leaflet: Synchronize paired notifications.
    This ensures users can't react to a visible child change notification or
    a fold change notification before we finish emitting all related
    notifications.
  * Add HdySqueezer.
    This can be used to automatically hide a widget like a HdyViewSwitcher
    in a header bar when there is not enough space for it and show a title
    label instead.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/100
  * examples: Use a HdySqueezer.
    Use a HdySqueezer in the view switcher window to show either the view
    switcher in the header bar, or a window title and a view switcher bar
    depending on the window's width.
  * view-switcher-button: Allow to elipsize in narrow mode.
    This will be used to let HdyViewSwitcherBar reach even narrower widths.
  * view-switcher: Allow to elipsize in narrow mode.
    This will be used to let HdyViewSwitcherBar reach even narrower widths.
  * view-switcher-bar: Ellipsize in narrow mode.
    This lets HdyViewSwitcherBar reach even narrower widths.
  * view-switcher-button: Use buttons borders in size.
    When computing the size of the button, take the button's border into
    account.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/108
  * view-switcher-bar: Sort properties by alphabetical order.
    This fixes a code style error and will avoid to propagate it as the file
    gets edited.
  * view-switcher-bar: Add margins.
    Add margings around the view switcher to better match the mockups.
  * view-switcher: Define a minimum natural width.
    This prevents the buttons from looking terribly narrow in a wide bar by
    making them request a minimum good looking natural size.
  * Add HdyPreferencesRow.
    This will be used as the base row for the preferences window, offering
    data needed to search a preference entry.
  * action-row: Extend HdyPreferencesRow.
    This allows to use HdyActionRow and its derivatives as preferences rows.
  * Add HdyPreferencesGroup.
    This will be used to group preferences rows as a coherent group in a
    preferences page.
  * Add HdyPreferencesPage.
    This will be used to group preferences as pages in a preferences window.
  * Add HdyPreferencesWindow.
    This allows to easily create searchable preferences windows.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/101
  * examples: Add a HdyPreferencesWindow example
  * Add private GtkWindow functions.
    Add the private GtkWindow functions _gtk_window_toggle_maximized()
    and gtk_window_get_icon_for_size() which will be used in the next commit
    by HdyHeaderBar.
  * Add HdyHeaderBar.
    Fork GtkHeaderBar to help fixing shortcomings caused by adaptive designs
    or coming from GtkHeaderBar itself as features are not accepted into GTK
    3 anymore.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/102
  * examples: Use HdyHeaderBar in the View Switcher page.
    This correctly centers the view switcher and demoes HdyHeaderBar.
  * view-switcher: Recommend to use a HdyHeaderBar.
    This will help users of HdyViewSwitcher to know how to make it look
    good in a header bar.
  * examples: Drop un unused signal connection.
    This avoids a run time warning.
  * docs: Add images for HdyViewSwitcher and HdyViewSwitcherBar
  * preferences-window: Strictly center the header bar.
    This makes the header bar's widgets look better by ensuring they are
    always centered, even if it means they will be narrower.
  * conbo-row: Make the popover relative to the arrow.
    Consistently point to the arrow rather than sometimes to the arrow and
    sometimes to the invisible box containing the current value.
  * combo-row: Add HdyComboRowGetName.
    Replace HdyComboRowCreateLabelData by HdyComboRowGetName and keep a
    reference to in the combo row to allow accessing it externally. It will
    be needed to automatically handle converting the value into a name to
    display as the subtitle of the row.
  * combo-row: Add the use-subtitle property.
    Allow to display the current value as the subtitle rather than at the
    end of the row.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/95
  * header-bar: Render margins and borders.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/121

  [ Zander Brown ]
  * Add HdyViewSwitcherButton.
    This will be used in the next commit by HdyViewSwitcher.
  * Add HdyViewSwitcher.
    This more modern and adaptive take on GtkStackSwitcher helps building
    adaptive UIs for phones.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/64
  * Add HdyViewSwitcherBar.
    This action bar offers a HdyViewSwitcher and is designed to be put at
    the bottom of windows. It is designed to be revealed when the header bar
    doesn't have enough room to fit a HdyViewSwitcher, helping the windows
    to reach narrower widths.
  * examples: Add the View Switcher page.
    This example presents a HdyViewSwitcher and a HdyViewSwitcherBar in
    their own window. Currently both are visible at the same time, a later
    commit should make only one visible at a time, depending on the
    available width.

libhandy (0.0.9) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Benjamin Berg ]
  * glade: Mark ActionRow properties as translatable/icon.
    Without this, it is impossible to set the translatable flag in glade,
    making it hard to create proper UI definitions.

  [ Bastien Nocera ]
  * Use correct i18n include.
    From the Internationalization section of the GLib API docs:
    In order to use these macros in an application, you must include
    <glib/gi18n.h>. For use in a library, you must include <glib/gi18n-lib.h>
    after defining the GETTEXT_PACKAGE macro suitably for your library
  * Fix broken translations in all libhandy applications.
    Translations in all the applications using libhandy would be broken
    after a call to hdy_init() as it changed the default gettext translation
    domain.
    See https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/issues/393

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * examples: Update the Flatpak command.
    The command should changed with the demo application name.
  * leaflet: Improve the slide child transition description.
    This makes the slide child transition description match the one of the
    slide mode transition one.
  * action-row: Upcast self to check the activated row.
    Upcast the HdyActionRow rather than downcasting the activated row to
    compare their pointers. This prevents error messages when a sibbling row
    that isn't a HdyActionRow is activated. Also use a simple cast rather
    than a safe cast as it is there only to please the compiler and is
    useless for a pointer comparison and it's faster.
  * Drop 'dialer' from the UI resources path.
    This makes the UI file paths more correct and simpler.
  * leaflet: Add hdy_leaflet_stop_child_transition()
    This makes the code clearer by encapsulating child mode transition
    cancellation into its own function.
  * leaflet: Factorize bin window move and resize.
    This ensures we move or resize it consistently.
  * leaflet: Move the bin window on child transition cancellation.
    This avoids the children to be drawn out of place when a mode transition
    is triggered while a child transition was ongoing.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/93
  * Add HDY_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY.
    Add and use HDY_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY to help ensuring custom styling
    is applied consistently and correctly accross all the library.
  * expander-row: Move the custom style to a resource.
    This makes the code cleaner, easier to read, and simnpler to modify.
  * combo-row: Move the custom style to a resource.
    This makes the code cleaner, easier to read, and simnpler to modify.
  * expander-row: Add the expanded property.
    This can be used to reveal external widgets depending on the state of
    the row.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * debian: Test GObject introspection.
    This makes sure we have the typelib file installed correctly.
  * debian/tests: Drop API version from include.
    This makes sure we respect pkg-config's findings.
  * examples: Add API version to demo name.
    This makes different versions co-installable.
  * build: Don't hardcode API version
  * Release libhandy 0.0.9

libhandy (0.0.8) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * examples: Use the "frame" stylesheet on listboxes.
    This avoids using GtkFrame where it's not relevant and shows the
    example.
  * examples: Refactor the Dialer panel.
    This makes it more in line with the other panels.
  * examples: Refactor the Arrows panel.
    This makes it more in line with the other panels.
  * examples: Fix the Lists panel column width.
    We were accidentally using the widths from the Column panel.
  * examples: Fix a typo
  * action-row: Add the row-header style class to the header box.
    This will allow to style the row's header separately.
  * expander-row: Add the expander style class.
    This will allow to style the row's padding appropriately to be used as
    an expander.
  * README.md: Add GNOME Settings and GNOME Web to users
  * meson: Don't install if it's a static subproject
  * title-bar: Drop useless definitions and inclusions.
    These were copy and paste errors.
  * README.md: Add gnome-bluetooth as a user
  * examples: Rename the example program to handy-demo.
    This also renames the type and files to match the new name.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/81
  * meson: Fix the examples option description.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/82
  * expander-row: Animate the arrow rotation.
    Because we can!
  * leaflet: Support RTL languages when unfolded.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/86

  [ Benjamin Berg ]
  * Add -s -noreset to xvfb-run calls.
    Xvfb will close when the last client exists, which may be the cause of
    sporadic test failures. Add -s -noreset to the command line to prevent
    this from happening.
  * combo-row: Fix memory leak
    g_list_model_get_item returns a referenced GObject which needs to be
    unref'ed.
  * combo-row: Fix memory leak in set_for_enum
  * value-object: Add an object to stuff a GValue into a GListModel.
    This is useful to store arbitrary (but simple) values inside a
    HdyComboRow.
  * example: Use value object rather.
    The code was storing strings in labels, just to extract them again.
    Also, the code was leaking the labels as g_list_store_insert does not
    sink the reference of the passed object.
  * tests: Add tests for HdyValueObject
  * action-row: Destroy the contained widget.
    The GtkBox that contains everything is an internal child which must be
    destroyed explicitly.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * run.in: Set GLADE_MODULE_SEARCH_PATH as well.
    This makes sure we're using the freshly built module when running
    from the source tree.
  * Release libhandy 0.0.8

  [ Pellegrino Prevete ]
  * README: added Daty to example apps
  * build: Force default libdir location for libhandy target on Windows to
    keep MinGW compatibility

  [ Alexander Mikhaylenko ]
  * leaflet: Add missing check for moving child window.
    Prevent child window from moving in transitions that don't require it,
    instead just resize it.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/80
  * leaflet: Drop commented out 'under' child transition.
    It's going to be replaced with the actual implementation in the next
    commit.
  * leaflet: Make 'over' child transition symmetric.
    Implement 'under' child transition animation, use it for 'over' for right
    and down directions, matching 'over' description.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/79
  * leaflet: Add 'under' child transition.
    Use same animations as 'over', but with reversed directions.
    Documentation descriptions by Adrien Plazas.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/84
  * leaflet: Clip bottom child during child transitions.
    Prevents bottom child from being visible through the top one during 'over'
    and 'under' child transitions.

libhandy (0.0.7) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * glade: Add row widgets to the widget classes.  They are missing and don't
    appear in Glade.
  * glade: Add that HdySearchBar. It's in libhandy since 0.0.6
  * action-row: Handle show_all()
    This avoids an empty image, an empty subtitle and an empty prefixes box
    to be visible when calling show_all(), as they are handled by the row
    itself.
  * action-row: Add the Since annotation to properties
  * example: Make the row with no action non-activatable
  * tests: Init libhandy.
    This ensures we run the test the same way applications are expected to
    run libhandy.
  * docs: Add section for new symbols in 0.0.7
  * action-row: Add the activatable-widget property.
    This allows to bind the activation of the row by a click or a mnemonic
    to the activation of a widget.
  * action-row: Chain up the parent dispose method
  * combo-row: Release the model on dispose.
    This avoids errors when trying to disconnect signals on finalization.
  * combo-box: Rename selected_position to selecxted_index.
    This will better match the name for its accessors which will be added in
    the next commit.
  * combo-row: Add the selected-index property.
    This allows to access the selected item.
  * main: Explicitely load the resources in hdy_init()
    This is mandatory to use resources of a static version of libhandy, and
    is hence mandatory to allow to build libhandy as a static library.
  * meson: Bump Meson to 0.47.0.
    This is required to use the feature option type in the next commit.
  * meson: Make introspection and the Glade catalog features.
    This avoids having to disable them when their dependencies aren't
    available and it will allow to disable them properly when libhandy will
    be allowed to be built as a static library in the next commit.
  * meson: Allow to build as a static library.
    This also disables the Glade catalog as it doesn't work with a static
    libhandy.
  * action-row: Drop pointers to internals on destruction.
    This avoids crashes when trying to access pointers to already dropped
    widgets.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/69
  * expander-row: Drop pointers to internals on destruction.
    This avoids crashes when trying to access pointers to already dropped
    widgets.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/69
  * examples: Make the Dialog section look nicer.
    This improves the spacing, adds and icon and adds a description to the
    Dialog section.
  * dialog: Close when pressing the back button.
    Close the dialog instead of destroying it when clicking the back button.
    This is the same behavior as when pressing escape or clicking the close
    button and allows the dialog to be reused as some applications like to
    do.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/70

  [ louib ]
  * Add GNOME Contacts as example

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * HdyComboRow: Don't use g_autoptr for GEnumClass
    g_autoptr for GEnumClass was added post 2.56, so using it makes it
    harder for people to package for distros. Not using g_autoptr there
    doesn't make the code much less readable.
  * HdyDialer: Don't use class method slot for 'delete'
    We used the one of 'submit' so far due to a c'n'p error. (Closes: #67)
  * HdyComboRow: hdy_combo_row_get_model: Add missing scope annotation
  * gitlab-ci: Build static library.
    The library build is sufficiently different that we want to run the
    build and tests.
  * Release libhandy 0.0.7

  [ David Cordero ]
  * Update documentation regarding build dependencies

  [ Zander Brown ]
  * Implement HdyDialog, an adaptive GtkDialog
    https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/52
  * example: Add to example application.
    Silly simple demo of HdyDialog.

  [ Benjamin Berg ]
  * combo-row: Rework selected-index property setting and notification.
    The notify::selected-index signal was not selected in most cases. Rework
    the selection handling to ensure that it is always emited when it changes
    or if the module is replaced.
    Also fixed are a few checks on whether the selection index is valid.

libhandy (0.0.6) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * Set relevant ATK roles.
    This will help the widgets to be more accessible.
  * doc: Rephrase the unstability ack section.
    Rephrase the documentation explaining how to include libhandy in a way
    that could include other languages such as Vala.
  * doc: Document the unstability ack for Vala
  * Guard header inclusions with #pragma once.
    This standardizes the header inclusion guards to #pragma once, which
    shouldn't be a problem as we already were using it in some files.
  * hacking: Document header inclusion guard preferences
  * example: Disable more libhandy options in Flatpak.
    Disable generation of the GObject Introspection files, the VAPI and the
    tests in the example Flatpak as they are not used by it.
  * arrow: Use a measure() method.
    This will simplify porting to GTK+ 4.
  * column: Use a measure() method.
    This will simplify porting to GTK+ 4.
  * dialer-button: Use a measure() method.
    This will simplify porting to GTK+ 4.
  * leaflet: Use a measure() method.
    This will simplify porting to GTK+ 4.
  * init: Make the arguments optional.
    Annotate the arguments of hdy_init() with (optional) to specify that NULL
    arguments are valid. This also replaces the deprecated (allow-none) by
    (nullable) to specify that the array pointed at by argv can be NULL.
  * init: Document that libhandy can't be reinitialized
  * Normalize and document private header guards
  * Add HdySearchBar.
    This is similar to GtkSearchBar except it allows the central widget
    (typically a GtkEntry) to fill all the available space. This is needed to
    manage an entry's width via a HdyColumn, letting the entry (and by
    extention the search bar) have a limited maximum width while allowing it to
    shrink to accomodate smaller windows.
  * example: Add the 'Search bar' page.
    This adds a demo of HdySearchBar.
  * example: Put the content in a scrolled window.
    This ensures the example can fit windows of any height.  This also makes
    the stack containing the content non vertically homogeneous so the
    scrollbar appears only on examples needing it, while keeping it
    horizontally homogeneous for to keep when the leaflets will be folded
    consistent.
  * build: Set the shared object install directory.
    This is required for Meson subprojects to work as intended.
  * build: Do not install hdy-public-types.c.
    There is no point in installing this generated C file.
  * leaflet: Allow editing the children list when looping through it.
    This avoids potential crashes when destroying a leaflet and this avoids
    leaks as not all children where looped through as the children list was
    edited while being looped through when destroying the leaflet.  This fixes
    https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/42.
  * Add hdy_list_box_separator_header()
    This list box header update function is commonly used by many applications
    and is going to be used by HdyComboRow which is going to be added to
    libhandy later.This makes it available for everyone.
  * examples: Use hdy_list_box_separator_header()
    This makes the code simpler.
  * Add HdyActionRow.
    This implements a very commonly used list box row pattern and make it
    convenient to use. It is going to be used as the base class for many
    other commonly used row types.
  * examples: Use HdyRow.
    This makes the code simpler and demoes the widget.
  * Add HdyExpanderRow
  * Add HdyEnumValueObject.
    This will be used in the next commit to use enumeration values in a
    GListModel.
  * Add HdyComboRow
  * examples: Add the Lists page.
    This page presents GtkListBox related widgets like HdyRow and its
    descendants.
  * examples: Put the scrolled window in the end pane size group.
    This fixes the fold synchronization of the leaflets in the example
    application's window.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * hdy-enums: Make build reproducible.
    Use @basename@ instead of @filename@ since the later uses the full
    path which varies across builds.
  * HACKING: Clarify braces in if-else.
    Document common practice in the other files.
  * spec: Sort dependencies
  * spec: Build-depend on libgladeui-2.0
  * gitlab-ci: Deduplicate tags
  * gitlab-ci: Build on Fedora as well.
    This gives us more confidence that we build succesfully and without
    warnings on an OS much used by GNOME developers.  It also makes sure we
    validate the spec file.
  * gitlab-ci: Switch to clang-tools
    clang-3.9 does not contain scan-build anymore.
  * HdyHeaderGroup: Cleanup references to header bars in dispose.
    The dispose heandler is meant to break refs to other objects, not
    finalize.
  * HdyHeaderGroup: Disconnect from header bar's signals during dispose.  The
    header bars might still emit signals which leads to CRITICALS or actual
    crashes. Fixes parts of #56
  * docs: Add section for new symbols in 0.0.6
  * Annotate APIs new in 0.0.6
  * Release libhandy 0.0.6

  [ Alexander Mikhaylenko ]
  * init: Add (transfer none) to argv parameter.
    This allows to call the function from Vala more easily.
  * header-group: Ref itself instead of header bars.
    When adding a header bar, ref the header group and connect to 'destroy'
    signal of the header bar. When a header bar is destroyed or
    hdy_header_group_remove_header_bar() is called, unref the header bar and
    remove it from the list.
    This way, a non-empty header group is only destroyed after every header
    bar it contains has been removed from the group or destroyed.
    Fixes #56
  * Revert "HdyHeaderGroup: Disconnect from header bar's signals during
    dispose"
    Since commit c5bf27d44022bdfa94b3f560aac8c22115e06363 header bars are
    destroyed before header group, so when destroying the header group, the
    list of header bars is always empty, so there's nothing to unref anymore.
    Reverts commit 14e5fc7b923440a99c3a62635cf895e73c5a49cd.

libhandy (0.0.5) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * Release libhandy 0.0.5
  * meson: Properly depend on the generated headers.
    This fixes dependency problems with the generated headers such as
        https://arm01.puri.sm/job/debs/job/deb-libhandy-buster-armhf/263/console
    See
        http://mesonbuild.com/Wrap-best-practices-and-tips.html#eclare-generated-headers-explicitly
  * debian: Make sure we create a strict shlibs file libhandy's ABI changes a
    lot so make sure we generate dependencies that always require the upstream
    version built against.
  * debian: Mark buil-deps for tests as <!nocheck>
  * gitlab-ci: Deduplicate before_script
  * gitlab-ci: Build with clang (scan-build) as well.
    We currently don't fail on warnings:
        https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/issues/4334
  * HdyLeaflet: Remove unused initializations spotted by clang
  * doc: Add that virtual methods carry the class prefix (Closes: #53)
  * docs: Add libhandy users.  This allows to find in uses examples easily.
  * docs: Mention meson as well.  Fewer and fewer GNOME projects use
    autotools.
  * docs: Drop package_ver_str from include path.  We add this in the
    pkg-config file so no need to specify it again.
  * Add i18n infrastructure
  * Add hdy_init() This initializes i18n. (Closes: #36)
  * meson: Depend on glib that supports g_auto*. Related to #33
  * HACKING: document using g_auto* is o.k. (Closes: #33)
  * HACKING: Use syntax highlighting.
  * Drop Jenkinsfile.  We run in gitlab-ci now
  * build: Detect if ld supports a version script.  This is e.g. not the case
    for Clang on OSX. (Closes: #58)

  [ Jeremy Bicha ]
  * debian: Have libhandy-0.0-dev depend on libgtk-3-dev (Closes: #910384)
  * debian: Use dh --with gir so that gir1.2-handy gets its dependencies set
    correctly
  * debian: Simplify debian/rules.

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * example: Drop Glade support in flatpak build.
  * main: Init public GObject types in hdy_init() This will avoid our users to
    manually ensure libhandy widget types are loaded before using them in
    GtkBuilder templates.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/20
  * dialer: Descend from GtkBin directly.
    Makes HdyDialer descend from GtkBin directly rather than from
    GtkEventBox. GtkEventBox will be dropped in GTK+ 4 and brings no
    functionality to HdyDialer.
  * example: Rename margin-left/right to margin-start/end.
    Left and right margin names are not RTL friendly and will be dropped in
    GTK+ 4.
  * HACKING.md: Rename margin-left to margin-start.
    Left and right margin names are not RTL friendly and will be dropped in
    GTK+ 4.
  * titlebar: Fix a mention of HdyLeaflet in the docs
  * example: Do not access event fields.
    This is needed to port to GTK+ 4 as these fields will be private.
  * dialer: Do not access event fields.
    This is needed to port to GTK+ 4 as these fields will be private.

  [ Alexander Mikhaylenko ]
  * example: Remove styles present in GTK+ 3.24.1.
    Libhandy requires `gtk+-3.0 >= 3.24.1` anyway, so these styles aren't
    necessary, and also break upstream `.devel` style.

  [ Jan Tojnar ]
  * Use pkg-config for obtaining glade catalogdir

libhandy (0.0.4) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Mohammed Sadiq ]
  * dialer-button: Fix emitting signal.
    As the properties where set to not explicitly fire ::notify, no
    signals where emitted. Let it be not explicit so that
    the signal will be emitted on change
  * ci: Enable code coverage.
    GitLab pages isn't supported now. So simply store the artifacts.
  * README: Add build and coverage status images
  * dialer: Handle delete button long press.
    Make the delete button clear the whole user input on long press

  [ Alexander Mikhaylenko ]
  * example: Remove sidebar border less aggressively.
    Applying the style to every element inside 'stacksidebar' also removes
    border from unrelated elements such as scrollbars. Hence only remove it
    from lists.

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * leaflet: Add the folded property.
    This is a boolean equivalent of the fold property, it is a needed
    convenience as is can be used in GtkBuilder declarations while the fold
    property is more convenient to use from C as it enables stronger typing.
  * example: Bind back and close buttons visibility to fold.
    Directly bind whether the back button and the close button are visible
    to whether the headerbar is folded.
  * Add HdyHeaderGroup
  * example: Use a HdyHeaderGroup.
    This automatically updates the headerbars' window decoration layout.
  * dialer-button: Replace digit and letters by symbols.
    Unify the digit and the letters of a dialer button as its symbols. This
    allows to make the code simpler by limiting the number of special cases.
    digit. This also handles Unicode characters.
  * dialer-cycle-button: Don't make the secondary label dim.
    This helps making it clear that these symbols are available, contrary to
    the dim ones from a regular dialer button.
  * dialer-button: Make the secondary label smaller.
    Makes the secondary text smaller to better match the mockups for Calls.
  * Add CSS names to the widgets
  * leaflet: Document the fold and folded properties
  * dialer: Set buttons checked instead setting relief.
    When digit keys are pressed, check the buttons state to checked rather
    than changing the relief.
  * dialer: Add the relief property.
    This allows to set the relief of the dialer buttons.
  * header-group: Drop forgotten log.
    This was accidentally left in.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/47
  * example: Let the Column panel reach narrower widths.
    Readjust the column widget's margins and ellipsize its labels to let it
    reach narrower widths.
  * example: Separate the listbox items
  * example: Let the Dialer panel reach narrower widths.
    Put the dialer into a column rather than forcing its width to let it
    reach narrower widths.
  * example: Enlarge the dialer label.
    This makes the dialed number more readable.
  * example: Let the Welcome panel reach narrower widths.
    Let the welcome panel's labels wrap to let it reach narrower widths.
  * header-group: Sanitize the decoration layout.
    Checks whether the decoration layout is NULL, empty or has at least one
    colon.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/44
  * header-group: Better handle references of header bars.
    Take a reference when adding a header bar, release them on destruction
    and don't take extra references on the focused child. This avoids using
    pointers to dead header bars or to leak them.
  * header-group: Fix the type of the focus property.
    This also fixes the types of the accessor functions.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/46
  * header-group: Fix the docs of the focus property.
    This also improves the documentation of its accessor functions.
  * header-group: Guard the focused header bar setter.
    Better guard the focused header bar setter by checking that the set
    header bar actually is one and is part of the group.
  * meson: Require GTK+ 3.24.1 or newer.
    GTK+ 3.24.1 received style fixes required for HdyTitleBar to work as
    expected.

  [ Felix Pojtinger ]
  * docs: Format README to enable syntax highlighting.
    This also adds code fences and blanks around headers.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * Depend on generated headers.
    If tests or examples are built early we want that hdy-enums.h is alread
    there.
  * docs: Add HdyFold.
    This makes sure it can be linked to by HdyLeaflet.
  * HdyLealflet: Use glib-mkenums.
    This makes the enums clickable in the HdyLeaflet documentation
    and makes the code smaller.
  * HdyFold: Use glib-mkenums.
    This makes the enums clickable in the HdyLeaflet documentation,
    HdyFold usable in GtkBuild and makes the code smaller.
  * HdyHeaderGroup: Document hdy_group_set_focus()
    This makes newer newer Gir scanner happy (and is a good thing anyway).
  * debian: Update shared library symbols
  * d/rules: Set a proper locale for the tests.
  * Check the debian package build during CI as well.
    This make sure we notice build breackage before it hits Jenkins to build
    the official debs.
  * ci: Fail on gtkdoc warnings.
    Gitlab seems to get confused by the '!' expression so use if instead.
  * tests: Test hdy_header_group_{get,set}_focus
  * HdyDialer: Apply 'keypad' style class.
    This applies the 'keypad' style class to both the keypad itself and its
    buttons. This allows to style the buttons and the keypad in the
    application.
  * glade: Verify catalog data via xmllint
  * debian: Add dependenies for running xmllint.
    This also makes sure we have it available during CI
  * HdyHeaderGroup: Allow to get and remove the headerbars
  * debian: Add new symbols
  * glade: Add a module so we can handle HdyHeaderGroup
  * run: Add glade lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
    This makes it simple to test the built version.
  * Move glade catalog from data/ to glade/
    Given that there will be more complex widgets lets keep the catalog
    and module together.
  * glade: Use a custom DTD.
    Glades DTD is not up to date. Use a custom copy until this is fixed
    upstream:
        https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glade/merge_requests/11
    We do this as a separate commit so we can revert it once upstream glade is
    fixed.
  * glade: Support HdyHeaderGroup (Closes: #38)
  * debian: Ship glade module

libhandy (0.0.3) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * New HdyTitleBar widget. This coupled with a transparent headerbar
    background can work around graphical glitches when animation header bars
    in a leaflet.
  * column: Add the linear-growth-width property
  * glade: Fix the generic name of HdyArrows
  * flatpak: Switch the runtime of the example to master.
  * column: Add a missing break statement.
  * leaflet: Hide children on transition end only when folded.
  * leaflet: Init mode transition positions to the final values.
  * example: Always show a close button.
  * example: Load custom style from CSS resource
  * example: Draw the right color for sidebar separators.
  * example: Use separators to separate the panels.
  * leaflet: Start the child transition only when folded.

  [ Christopher Davis ]
  * Add HdyColumn to libhandy.xml for glade.

  [ Heather Ellsworth ]
  * Add issue template

  [ Jordan Petridis ]
  * leaflet: initialize a variable.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * HdyButton: Chain up to parent on finalize
  * gitlab-ci: Fail on compile warnings
  * meson: Warn about possible uninitialized variables
  * HdyLeaflet: Fix two uninitialized variables
  * Update list of compiler warnings from phosh
    and fix the fallout.

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * dialer: Make the grid visible and forbid show all.
  * example: Drop usage of show_all()
  * dialer: Add column-spacing and row-spacing props.
  * example: Change the grid's spacing and minimum size request.
  * flatpak: Allow access to the dconf config dir.
  * Replace phone-dial-symbolic by call-start-symbolic.

  * Release 0.0.1

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * Add HdyColumn widget

libhandy (0.0~git20180517) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add an arrows widget.
    The widget prints a number of arrows one by one to indicate a sliding
    direction. Number of arrows and animation duration are configurable.
  * Add symbols file

libhandy (0.0~git20180429) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * New git snapshot
  * HdyDialer: Emit symbol-clicked signal.  This signal is emitted when a
    symbol button (numbers or '#' or '*') is clicked.
  * HdyDialer: Emit signal when delete button was clicked.
  * dialer: Make it simple to clear the stored number.
    This also makes sure we don't send multiple number changed events
    when nothing changed.
  * dialer: Delay number notify.  On button press send out the number changed
    signal at the very end so listeners can process the button event prior to
    the number update event.

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * leaflet: Refactor homogeneity.
    This makes factorizes the homogeneity functions of HdyLeaflet to make
    the code a bit shorter.
  * build: Add '--c-include=handy.h' GIR options back.
    This is necessary for introspection to know the header file to use.
  * dialer: Check params of the 'number' prop accessors.
    Sanitize the parameters of the 'number' property accessor. This will
    warn or misusages of the API at runtime and avoid potential crashes.
  * dialer: Style cleanup of the 'number' prop accessors.
    Use gchar instead of char, use GNOME style pointer spacing and name the
    number parameter 'number'. This is all cosmetic but will make the code
    look a bit more GNOME-like.
  * example: Drop hardcoded default window size.
    This avoid overridding with the one we set in the the .ui file of the
    window.
  * example: Move window title to .ui file.
    This avoid hardcoding values when we can put them in the UI description.
  * example-window: Make the default size more phone-like

  [ Bob Ham ]
  * dialer: Add "show-action-buttons" property.
    Add a new boolean "show-action-buttons" property that specifies
    whether the submit and delete buttons are displayed.
