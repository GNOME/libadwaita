libhandy (0.0.10) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * .editorconfig: Add CSS
  * arrows: Refresh HdyArrowsDirection docs.
    This moves the HdyArrowsDirection documentation to the C file and
    removes the final period from the values definitions, like for all other
    enums documentations.
  * docs: Add section for new symbols in 0.0.10
  * view-switcher: Fix stack children callbacks.
    This fixes the callbacks when a child is added or removed from the view
    switcher's stack.
  * view-switcher-button: Make an active button's label bold.
    This makes the view switcher easier to read.
    It uses multiple labels with or without the specific style rather than a
    single label with the style toggled on and off to ensure the size
    requests don't change depending on whether the button is active or not.
  * leaflet: Synchronize paired notifications.
    This ensures users can't react to a visible child change notification or
    a fold change notification before we finish emitting all related
    notifications.
  * Add HdySqueezer.
    This can be used to automatically hide a widget like a HdyViewSwitcher
    in a header bar when there is not enough space for it and show a title
    label instead.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/100
  * examples: Use a HdySqueezer.
    Use a HdySqueezer in the view switcher window to show either the view
    switcher in the header bar, or a window title and a view switcher bar
    depending on the window's width.
  * view-switcher-button: Allow to elipsize in narrow mode.
    This will be used to let HdyViewSwitcherBar reach even narrower widths.
  * view-switcher: Allow to elipsize in narrow mode.
    This will be used to let HdyViewSwitcherBar reach even narrower widths.
  * view-switcher-bar: Ellipsize in narrow mode.
    This lets HdyViewSwitcherBar reach even narrower widths.
  * view-switcher-button: Use buttons borders in size.
    When computing the size of the button, take the button's border into
    account.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/108
  * view-switcher-bar: Sort properties by alphabetical order.
    This fixes a code style error and will avoid to propagate it as the file
    gets edited.
  * view-switcher-bar: Add margins.
    Add margings around the view switcher to better match the mockups.
  * view-switcher: Define a minimum natural width.
    This prevents the buttons from looking terribly narrow in a wide bar by
    making them request a minimum good looking natural size.
  * Add HdyPreferencesRow.
    This will be used as the base row for the preferences window, offering
    data needed to search a preference entry.
  * action-row: Extend HdyPreferencesRow.
    This allows to use HdyActionRow and its derivatives as preferences rows.
  * Add HdyPreferencesGroup.
    This will be used to group preferences rows as a coherent group in a
    preferences page.
  * Add HdyPreferencesPage.
    This will be used to group preferences as pages in a preferences window.
  * Add HdyPreferencesWindow.
    This allows to easily create searchable preferences windows.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/101
  * examples: Add a HdyPreferencesWindow example
  * Add private GtkWindow functions.
    Add the private GtkWindow functions _gtk_window_toggle_maximized()
    and gtk_window_get_icon_for_size() which will be used in the next commit
    by HdyHeaderBar.
  * Add HdyHeaderBar.
    Fork GtkHeaderBar to help fixing shortcomings caused by adaptive designs
    or coming from GtkHeaderBar itself as features are not accepted into GTK
    3 anymore.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/102
  * examples: Use HdyHeaderBar in the View Switcher page.
    This correctly centers the view switcher and demoes HdyHeaderBar.
  * view-switcher: Recommend to use a HdyHeaderBar.
    This will help users of HdyViewSwitcher to know how to make it look
    good in a header bar.
  * examples: Drop un unused signal connection.
    This avoids a run time warning.
  * docs: Add images for HdyViewSwitcher and HdyViewSwitcherBar
  * preferences-window: Strictly center the header bar.
    This makes the header bar's widgets look better by ensuring they are
    always centered, even if it means they will be narrower.
  * conbo-row: Make the popover relative to the arrow.
    Consistently point to the arrow rather than sometimes to the arrow and
    sometimes to the invisible box containing the current value.
  * combo-row: Add HdyComboRowGetName.
    Replace HdyComboRowCreateLabelData by HdyComboRowGetName and keep a
    reference to in the combo row to allow accessing it externally. It will
    be needed to automatically handle converting the value into a name to
    display as the subtitle of the row.
  * combo-row: Add the use-subtitle property.
    Allow to display the current value as the subtitle rather than at the
    end of the row.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/95
  * header-bar: Render margins and borders.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/121

  [ Zander Brown ]
  * Add HdyViewSwitcherButton.
    This will be used in the next commit by HdyViewSwitcher.
  * Add HdyViewSwitcher.
    This more modern and adaptive take on GtkStackSwitcher helps building
    adaptive UIs for phones.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/64
  * Add HdyViewSwitcherBar.
    This action bar offers a HdyViewSwitcher and is designed to be put at
    the bottom of windows. It is designed to be revealed when the header bar
    doesn't have enough room to fit a HdyViewSwitcher, helping the windows
    to reach narrower widths.
  * examples: Add the View Switcher page.
    This example presents a HdyViewSwitcher and a HdyViewSwitcherBar in
    their own window. Currently both are visible at the same time, a later
    commit should make only one visible at a time, depending on the
    available width.

  [ Aearil ]

libhandy (0.0.9) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Benjamin Berg ]
  * glade: Mark ActionRow properties as translatable/icon.
    Without this, it is impossible to set the translatable flag in glade,
    making it hard to create proper UI definitions.

  [ Bastien Nocera ]
  * Use correct i18n include.
    From the Internationalization section of the GLib API docs:
    In order to use these macros in an application, you must include
    <glib/gi18n.h>. For use in a library, you must include <glib/gi18n-lib.h>
    after defining the GETTEXT_PACKAGE macro suitably for your library
  * Fix broken translations in all libhandy applications.
    Translations in all the applications using libhandy would be broken
    after a call to hdy_init() as it changed the default gettext translation
    domain.
    See https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/issues/393

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * examples: Update the Flatpak command.
    The command should changed with the demo application name.
  * leaflet: Improve the slide child transition description.
    This makes the slide child transition description match the one of the
    slide mode transition one.
  * action-row: Upcast self to check the activated row.
    Upcast the HdyActionRow rather than downcasting the activated row to
    compare their pointers. This prevents error messages when a sibbling row
    that isn't a HdyActionRow is activated. Also use a simple cast rather
    than a safe cast as it is there only to please the compiler and is
    useless for a pointer comparison and it's faster.
  * Drop 'dialer' from the UI resources path.
    This makes the UI file paths more correct and simpler.
  * leaflet: Add hdy_leaflet_stop_child_transition()
    This makes the code clearer by encapsulating child mode transition
    cancellation into its own function.
  * leaflet: Factorize bin window move and resize.
    This ensures we move or resize it consistently.
  * leaflet: Move the bin window on child transition cancellation.
    This avoids the children to be drawn out of place when a mode transition
    is triggered while a child transition was ongoing.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/93
  * Add HDY_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY.
    Add and use HDY_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY to help ensuring custom styling
    is applied consistently and correctly accross all the library.
  * expander-row: Move the custom style to a resource.
    This makes the code cleaner, easier to read, and simnpler to modify.
  * combo-row: Move the custom style to a resource.
    This makes the code cleaner, easier to read, and simnpler to modify.
  * expander-row: Add the expanded property.
    This can be used to reveal external widgets depending on the state of
    the row.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * debian: Test GObject introspection.
    This makes sure we have the typelib file installed correctly.
  * debian/tests: Drop API version from include.
    This makes sure we respect pkg-config's findings.
  * examples: Add API version to demo name.
    This makes different versions co-installable.
  * build: Don't hardcode API version
  * Release libhandy 0.0.9

libhandy (0.0.8) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * examples: Use the "frame" stylesheet on listboxes.
    This avoids using GtkFrame where it's not relevant and shows the
    example.
  * examples: Refactor the Dialer panel.
    This makes it more in line with the other panels.
  * examples: Refactor the Arrows panel.
    This makes it more in line with the other panels.
  * examples: Fix the Lists panel column width.
    We were accidentally using the widths from the Column panel.
  * examples: Fix a typo
  * action-row: Add the row-header style class to the header box.
    This will allow to style the row's header separately.
  * expander-row: Add the expander style class.
    This will allow to style the row's padding appropriately to be used as
    an expander.
  * README.md: Add GNOME Settings and GNOME Web to users
  * meson: Don't install if it's a static subproject
  * title-bar: Drop useless definitions and inclusions.
    These were copy and paste errors.
  * README.md: Add gnome-bluetooth as a user
  * examples: Rename the example program to handy-demo.
    This also renames the type and files to match the new name.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/81
  * meson: Fix the examples option description.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/82
  * expander-row: Animate the arrow rotation.
    Because we can!
  * leaflet: Support RTL languages when unfolded.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/86

  [ Benjamin Berg ]
  * Add -s -noreset to xvfb-run calls.
    Xvfb will close when the last client exists, which may be the cause of
    sporadic test failures. Add -s -noreset to the command line to prevent
    this from happening.
  * combo-row: Fix memory leak
    g_list_model_get_item returns a referenced GObject which needs to be
    unref'ed.
  * combo-row: Fix memory leak in set_for_enum
  * value-object: Add an object to stuff a GValue into a GListModel.
    This is useful to store arbitrary (but simple) values inside a
    HdyComboRow.
  * example: Use value object rather.
    The code was storing strings in labels, just to extract them again.
    Also, the code was leaking the labels as g_list_store_insert does not
    sink the reference of the passed object.
  * tests: Add tests for HdyValueObject
  * action-row: Destroy the contained widget.
    The GtkBox that contains everything is an internal child which must be
    destroyed explicitly.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * run.in: Set GLADE_MODULE_SEARCH_PATH as well.
    This makes sure we're using the freshly built module when running
    from the source tree.
  * Release libhandy 0.0.8

  [ Pellegrino Prevete ]
  * README: added Daty to example apps
  * build: Force default libdir location for libhandy target on Windows to
    keep MinGW compatibility

  [ Alexander Mikhaylenko ]
  * leaflet: Add missing check for moving child window.
    Prevent child window from moving in transitions that don't require it,
    instead just resize it.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/80
  * leaflet: Drop commented out 'under' child transition.
    It's going to be replaced with the actual implementation in the next
    commit.
  * leaflet: Make 'over' child transition symmetric.
    Implement 'under' child transition animation, use it for 'over' for right
    and down directions, matching 'over' description.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/79
  * leaflet: Add 'under' child transition.
    Use same animations as 'over', but with reversed directions.
    Documentation descriptions by Adrien Plazas.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/84
  * leaflet: Clip bottom child during child transitions.
    Prevents bottom child from being visible through the top one during 'over'
    and 'under' child transitions.

  [ maxice8 ]
  * meson: pass -DHANDY_COMPILATION to GIR compiler.
    Fixes cross compilation of GIR in Void Linux.

libhandy (0.0.7) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * glade: Add row widgets to the widget classes.  They are missing and don't
    appear in Glade.
  * glade: Add that HdySearchBar. It's in libhandy since 0.0.6
  * action-row: Handle show_all()
    This avoids an empty image, an empty subtitle and an empty prefixes box
    to be visible when calling show_all(), as they are handled by the row
    itself.
  * action-row: Add the Since annotation to properties
  * example: Make the row with no action non-activatable
  * tests: Init libhandy.
    This ensures we run the test the same way applications are expected to
    run libhandy.
  * docs: Add section for new symbols in 0.0.7
  * action-row: Add the activatable-widget property.
    This allows to bind the activation of the row by a click or a mnemonic
    to the activation of a widget.
  * action-row: Chain up the parent dispose method
  * combo-row: Release the model on dispose.
    This avoids errors when trying to disconnect signals on finalization.
  * combo-box: Rename selected_position to selecxted_index.
    This will better match the name for its accessors which will be added in
    the next commit.
  * combo-row: Add the selected-index property.
    This allows to access the selected item.
  * main: Explicitely load the resources in hdy_init()
    This is mandatory to use resources of a static version of libhandy, and
    is hence mandatory to allow to build libhandy as a static library.
  * meson: Bump Meson to 0.47.0.
    This is required to use the feature option type in the next commit.
  * meson: Make introspection and the Glade catalog features.
    This avoids having to disable them when their dependencies aren't
    available and it will allow to disable them properly when libhandy will
    be allowed to be built as a static library in the next commit.
  * meson: Allow to build as a static library.
    This also disables the Glade catalog as it doesn't work with a static
    libhandy.
  * action-row: Drop pointers to internals on destruction.
    This avoids crashes when trying to access pointers to already dropped
    widgets.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/69
  * expander-row: Drop pointers to internals on destruction.
    This avoids crashes when trying to access pointers to already dropped
    widgets.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/69
  * examples: Make the Dialog section look nicer.
    This improves the spacing, adds and icon and adds a description to the
    Dialog section.
  * dialog: Close when pressing the back button.
    Close the dialog instead of destroying it when clicking the back button.
    This is the same behavior as when pressing escape or clicking the close
    button and allows the dialog to be reused as some applications like to
    do.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/70

  [ louib ]
  * Add GNOME Contacts as example

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * HdyComboRow: Don't use g_autoptr for GEnumClass
    g_autoptr for GEnumClass was added post 2.56, so using it makes it
    harder for people to package for distros. Not using g_autoptr there
    doesn't make the code much less readable.
  * HdyDialer: Don't use class method slot for 'delete'
    We used the one of 'submit' so far due to a c'n'p error. (Closes: #67)
  * HdyComboRow: hdy_combo_row_get_model: Add missing scope annotation
  * gitlab-ci: Build static library.
    The library build is sufficiently different that we want to run the
    build and tests.
  * Release libhandy 0.0.7

  [ David Cordero ]
  * Update documentation regarding build dependencies

  [ Zander Brown ]
  * Implement HdyDialog, an adaptive GtkDialog
    https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/52
  * example: Add to example application.
    Silly simple demo of HdyDialog.

  [ Benjamin Berg ]
  * combo-row: Rework selected-index property setting and notification.
    The notify::selected-index signal was not selected in most cases. Rework
    the selection handling to ensure that it is always emited when it changes
    or if the module is replaced.
    Also fixed are a few checks on whether the selection index is valid.

libhandy (0.0.6) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * Set relevant ATK roles.
    This will help the widgets to be more accessible.
  * doc: Rephrase the unstability ack section.
    Rephrase the documentation explaining how to include libhandy in a way
    that could include other languages such as Vala.
  * doc: Document the unstability ack for Vala
  * Guard header inclusions with #pragma once.
    This standardizes the header inclusion guards to #pragma once, which
    shouldn't be a problem as we already were using it in some files.
  * hacking: Document header inclusion guard preferences
  * example: Disable more libhandy options in Flatpak.
    Disable generation of the GObject Introspection files, the VAPI and the
    tests in the example Flatpak as they are not used by it.
  * arrow: Use a measure() method.
    This will simplify porting to GTK+ 4.
  * column: Use a measure() method.
    This will simplify porting to GTK+ 4.
  * dialer-button: Use a measure() method.
    This will simplify porting to GTK+ 4.
  * leaflet: Use a measure() method.
    This will simplify porting to GTK+ 4.
  * init: Make the arguments optional.
    Annotate the arguments of hdy_init() with (optional) to specify that NULL
    arguments are valid. This also replaces the deprecated (allow-none) by
    (nullable) to specify that the array pointed at by argv can be NULL.
  * init: Document that libhandy can't be reinitialized
  * Normalize and document private header guards
  * Add HdySearchBar.
    This is similar to GtkSearchBar except it allows the central widget
    (typically a GtkEntry) to fill all the available space. This is needed to
    manage an entry's width via a HdyColumn, letting the entry (and by
    extention the search bar) have a limited maximum width while allowing it to
    shrink to accomodate smaller windows.
  * example: Add the 'Search bar' page.
    This adds a demo of HdySearchBar.
  * example: Put the content in a scrolled window.
    This ensures the example can fit windows of any height.  This also makes
    the stack containing the content non vertically homogeneous so the
    scrollbar appears only on examples needing it, while keeping it
    horizontally homogeneous for to keep when the leaflets will be folded
    consistent.
  * build: Set the shared object install directory.
    This is required for Meson subprojects to work as intended.
  * build: Do not install hdy-public-types.c.
    There is no point in installing this generated C file.
  * leaflet: Allow editing the children list when looping through it.
    This avoids potential crashes when destroying a leaflet and this avoids
    leaks as not all children where looped through as the children list was
    edited while being looped through when destroying the leaflet.  This fixes
    https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/42.
  * Add hdy_list_box_separator_header()
    This list box header update function is commonly used by many applications
    and is going to be used by HdyComboRow which is going to be added to
    libhandy later.This makes it available for everyone.
  * examples: Use hdy_list_box_separator_header()
    This makes the code simpler.
  * Add HdyActionRow.
    This implements a very commonly used list box row pattern and make it
    convenient to use. It is going to be used as the base class for many
    other commonly used row types.
  * examples: Use HdyRow.
    This makes the code simpler and demoes the widget.
  * Add HdyExpanderRow
  * Add HdyEnumValueObject.
    This will be used in the next commit to use enumeration values in a
    GListModel.
  * Add HdyComboRow
  * examples: Add the Lists page.
    This page presents GtkListBox related widgets like HdyRow and its
    descendants.
  * examples: Put the scrolled window in the end pane size group.
    This fixes the fold synchronization of the leaflets in the example
    application's window.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * hdy-enums: Make build reproducible.
    Use @basename@ instead of @filename@ since the later uses the full
    path which varies across builds.
  * HACKING: Clarify braces in if-else.
    Document common practice in the other files.
  * spec: Sort dependencies
  * spec: Build-depend on libgladeui-2.0
  * gitlab-ci: Deduplicate tags
  * gitlab-ci: Build on Fedora as well.
    This gives us more confidence that we build succesfully and without
    warnings on an OS much used by GNOME developers.  It also makes sure we
    validate the spec file.
  * gitlab-ci: Switch to clang-tools
    clang-3.9 does not contain scan-build anymore.
  * HdyHeaderGroup: Cleanup references to header bars in dispose.
    The dispose heandler is meant to break refs to other objects, not
    finalize.
  * HdyHeaderGroup: Disconnect from header bar's signals during dispose.  The
    header bars might still emit signals which leads to CRITICALS or actual
    crashes. Fixes parts of #56
  * docs: Add section for new symbols in 0.0.6
  * Annotate APIs new in 0.0.6
  * Release libhandy 0.0.6

  [ Alexander Mikhaylenko ]
  * init: Add (transfer none) to argv parameter.
    This allows to call the function from Vala more easily.
  * header-group: Ref itself instead of header bars.
    When adding a header bar, ref the header group and connect to 'destroy'
    signal of the header bar. When a header bar is destroyed or
    hdy_header_group_remove_header_bar() is called, unref the header bar and
    remove it from the list.
    This way, a non-empty header group is only destroyed after every header
    bar it contains has been removed from the group or destroyed.
    Fixes #56
  * Revert "HdyHeaderGroup: Disconnect from header bar's signals during
    dispose"
    Since commit c5bf27d44022bdfa94b3f560aac8c22115e06363 header bars are
    destroyed before header group, so when destroying the header group, the
    list of header bars is always empty, so there's nothing to unref anymore.
    Reverts commit 14e5fc7b923440a99c3a62635cf895e73c5a49cd.

libhandy (0.0.5) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * Release libhandy 0.0.5
  * meson: Properly depend on the generated headers.
    This fixes dependency problems with the generated headers such as

    See
        http://mesonbuild.com/Wrap-best-practices-and-tips.html#eclare-generated-headers-explicitly
  * debian: Make sure we create a strict shlibs file libhandy's ABI changes a
    lot so make sure we generate dependencies that always require the upstream
    version built against.
  * debian: Mark buil-deps for tests as <!nocheck>
  * gitlab-ci: Deduplicate before_script
  * gitlab-ci: Build with clang (scan-build) as well.
    We currently don't fail on warnings:
        https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/issues/4334
  * HdyLeaflet: Remove unused initializations spotted by clang
  * doc: Add that virtual methods carry the class prefix (Closes: #53)
  * docs: Add libhandy users.  This allows to find in uses examples easily.
  * docs: Mention meson as well.  Fewer and fewer GNOME projects use
    autotools.
  * docs: Drop package_ver_str from include path.  We add this in the
    pkg-config file so no need to specify it again.
  * Add i18n infrastructure
  * Add hdy_init() This initializes i18n. (Closes: #36)
  * meson: Depend on glib that supports g_auto*. Related to #33
  * HACKING: document using g_auto* is o.k. (Closes: #33)
  * HACKING: Use syntax highlighting.
  * Drop Jenkinsfile.  We run in gitlab-ci now
  * build: Detect if ld supports a version script.  This is e.g. not the case
    for Clang on OSX. (Closes: #58)

  [ Jeremy Bicha ]
  * debian: Have libhandy-0.0-dev depend on libgtk-3-dev (Closes: #910384)
  * debian: Use dh --with gir so that gir1.2-handy gets its dependencies set
    correctly
  * debian: Simplify debian/rules.

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * example: Drop Glade support in flatpak build.
  * main: Init public GObject types in hdy_init() This will avoid our users to
    manually ensure libhandy widget types are loaded before using them in
    GtkBuilder templates.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/20
  * dialer: Descend from GtkBin directly.
    Makes HdyDialer descend from GtkBin directly rather than from
    GtkEventBox. GtkEventBox will be dropped in GTK+ 4 and brings no
    functionality to HdyDialer.
  * example: Rename margin-left/right to margin-start/end.
    Left and right margin names are not RTL friendly and will be dropped in
    GTK+ 4.
  * HACKING.md: Rename margin-left to margin-start.
    Left and right margin names are not RTL friendly and will be dropped in
    GTK+ 4.
  * titlebar: Fix a mention of HdyLeaflet in the docs
  * example: Do not access event fields.
    This is needed to port to GTK+ 4 as these fields will be private.
  * dialer: Do not access event fields.
    This is needed to port to GTK+ 4 as these fields will be private.

  [ Alexander Mikhaylenko ]
  * example: Remove styles present in GTK+ 3.24.1.
    Libhandy requires `gtk+-3.0 >= 3.24.1` anyway, so these styles aren't
    necessary, and also break upstream `.devel` style.

  [ Jan Tojnar ]
  * Use pkg-config for obtaining glade catalogdir

libhandy (0.0.4) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Mohammed Sadiq ]
  * dialer-button: Fix emitting signal.
    As the properties where set to not explicitly fire ::notify, no
    signals where emitted. Let it be not explicit so that
    the signal will be emitted on change
  * ci: Enable code coverage.
    GitLab pages isn't supported now. So simply store the artifacts.
  * README: Add build and coverage status images
  * dialer: Handle delete button long press.
    Make the delete button clear the whole user input on long press

  [ Alexander Mikhaylenko ]
  * example: Remove sidebar border less aggressively.
    Applying the style to every element inside 'stacksidebar' also removes
    border from unrelated elements such as scrollbars. Hence only remove it
    from lists.

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * leaflet: Add the folded property.
    This is a boolean equivalent of the fold property, it is a needed
    convenience as is can be used in GtkBuilder declarations while the fold
    property is more convenient to use from C as it enables stronger typing.
  * example: Bind back and close buttons visibility to fold.
    Directly bind whether the back button and the close button are visible
    to whether the headerbar is folded.
  * Add HdyHeaderGroup
  * example: Use a HdyHeaderGroup.
    This automatically updates the headerbars' window decoration layout.
  * dialer-button: Replace digit and letters by symbols.
    Unify the digit and the letters of a dialer button as its symbols. This
    allows to make the code simpler by limiting the number of special cases.
    digit. This also handles Unicode characters.
  * dialer-cycle-button: Don't make the secondary label dim.
    This helps making it clear that these symbols are available, contrary to
    the dim ones from a regular dialer button.
  * dialer-button: Make the secondary label smaller.
    Makes the secondary text smaller to better match the mockups for Calls.
  * Add CSS names to the widgets
  * leaflet: Document the fold and folded properties
  * dialer: Set buttons checked instead setting relief.
    When digit keys are pressed, check the buttons state to checked rather
    than changing the relief.
  * dialer: Add the relief property.
    This allows to set the relief of the dialer buttons.
  * header-group: Drop forgotten log.
    This was accidentally left in.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/47
  * example: Let the Column panel reach narrower widths.
    Readjust the column widget's margins and ellipsize its labels to let it
    reach narrower widths.
  * example: Separate the listbox items
  * example: Let the Dialer panel reach narrower widths.
    Put the dialer into a column rather than forcing its width to let it
    reach narrower widths.
  * example: Enlarge the dialer label.
    This makes the dialed number more readable.
  * example: Let the Welcome panel reach narrower widths.
    Let the welcome panel's labels wrap to let it reach narrower widths.
  * header-group: Sanitize the decoration layout.
    Checks whether the decoration layout is NULL, empty or has at least one
    colon.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/44
  * header-group: Better handle references of header bars.
    Take a reference when adding a header bar, release them on destruction
    and don't take extra references on the focused child. This avoids using
    pointers to dead header bars or to leak them.
  * header-group: Fix the type of the focus property.
    This also fixes the types of the accessor functions.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/46
  * header-group: Fix the docs of the focus property.
    This also improves the documentation of its accessor functions.
  * header-group: Guard the focused header bar setter.
    Better guard the focused header bar setter by checking that the set
    header bar actually is one and is part of the group.
  * meson: Require GTK+ 3.24.1 or newer.
    GTK+ 3.24.1 received style fixes required for HdyTitleBar to work as
    expected.

  [ Felix Pojtinger ]
  * docs: Format README to enable syntax highlighting.
    This also adds code fences and blanks around headers.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * Depend on generated headers.
    If tests or examples are built early we want that hdy-enums.h is alread
    there.
  * docs: Add HdyFold.
    This makes sure it can be linked to by HdyLeaflet.
  * HdyLealflet: Use glib-mkenums.
    This makes the enums clickable in the HdyLeaflet documentation
    and makes the code smaller.
  * HdyFold: Use glib-mkenums.
    This makes the enums clickable in the HdyLeaflet documentation,
    HdyFold usable in GtkBuild and makes the code smaller.
  * HdyHeaderGroup: Document hdy_group_set_focus()
    This makes newer newer Gir scanner happy (and is a good thing anyway).
  * debian: Update shared library symbols
  * d/rules: Set a proper locale for the tests.
  * Check the debian package build during CI as well.
    This make sure we notice build breackage before it hits Jenkins to build
    the official debs.
  * ci: Fail on gtkdoc warnings.
    Gitlab seems to get confused by the '!' expression so use if instead.
  * tests: Test hdy_header_group_{get,set}_focus
  * HdyDialer: Apply 'keypad' style class.
    This applies the 'keypad' style class to both the keypad itself and its
    buttons. This allows to style the buttons and the keypad in the
    application.
  * glade: Verify catalog data via xmllint
  * debian: Add dependenies for running xmllint.
    This also makes sure we have it available during CI
  * HdyHeaderGroup: Allow to get and remove the headerbars
  * debian: Add new symbols
  * glade: Add a module so we can handle HdyHeaderGroup
  * run: Add glade lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
    This makes it simple to test the built version.
  * Move glade catalog from data/ to glade/
    Given that there will be more complex widgets lets keep the catalog
    and module together.
  * glade: Use a custom DTD.
    Glades DTD is not up to date. Use a custom copy until this is fixed
    upstream:
        https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glade/merge_requests/11
    We do this as a separate commit so we can revert it once upstream glade is
    fixed.
  * glade: Support HdyHeaderGroup (Closes: #38)
  * debian: Ship glade module

libhandy (0.0.3) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * New HdyTitleBar widget. This coupled with a transparent headerbar
    background can work around graphical glitches when animation header bars
    in a leaflet.
  * column: Add the linear-growth-width property
  * glade: Fix the generic name of HdyArrows
  * flatpak: Switch the runtime of the example to master.
  * column: Add a missing break statement.
  * leaflet: Hide children on transition end only when folded.
  * leaflet: Init mode transition positions to the final values.
  * example: Always show a close button.
  * example: Load custom style from CSS resource
  * example: Draw the right color for sidebar separators.
  * example: Use separators to separate the panels.
  * leaflet: Start the child transition only when folded.

  [ Christopher Davis ]
  * Add HdyColumn to libhandy.xml for glade.

  [ Heather Ellsworth ]
  * Add issue template

  [ Jordan Petridis ]

    The widget prints a number of arrows one by one to indicate a sliding
    direction. Number of arrows and animation duration are configurable.
  * Add symbols file

libhandy (0.0~git20180429) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * New git snapshot
  * HdyDialer: Emit symbol-clicked signal.  This signal is emitted when a
    symbol button (numbers or '#' or '*') is clicked.
  * HdyDialer: Emit signal when delete button was clicked.
  * dialer: Make it simple to clear the stored number.
    This also makes sure we don't send multiple number changed events
    when nothing changed.
  * dialer: Delay number notify.  On button press send out the number changed
    signal at the very end so listeners can process the button event prior to
    the number update event.

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * leaflet: Refactor homogeneity.
    This makes factorizes the homogeneity functions of HdyLeaflet to make
    the code a bit shorter.
  * build: Add '--c-include=handy.h' GIR options back.
    This is necessary for introspection to know the header file to use.
  * dialer: Check params of the 'number' prop accessors.
    Sanitize the parameters of the 'number' property accessor. This will
    warn or misusages of the API at runtime and avoid potential crashes.
  * dialer: Style cleanup of the 'number' prop accessors.
    Use gchar instead of char, use GNOME style pointer spacing and name the
    number parameter 'number'. This is all cosmetic but will make the code
    look a bit more GNOME-like.
  * example: Drop hardcoded default window size.
    This avoid overridding with the one we set in the the .ui file of the
    window.
  * example: Move window title to .ui file.
    This avoid hardcoding values when we can put them in the UI description.
  * example-window: Make the default size more phone-like

  [ Bob Ham ]
  * dialer: Add "show-action-buttons" property.
    Add a new boolean "show-action-buttons" property that specifies
    whether the submit and delete buttons are displayed.
