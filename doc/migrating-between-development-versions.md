# Migrating between development versions

This guide outlines the differences between Libadwaita development releases.
It assumes you've already migrated from Libhandy 1.4 to Libadwaita, or you
created a new project using a development release of Libadwaita.

If you want to migrate from Libhandy 1.4 to the latest Libadwaita release,
[follow this guide](migrating-libhandy-1-4-to-libadwaita.html).

## Migrating from alpha 1 to alpha 2

### Adapt to view switcher API Changes

[class@Adw.ViewSwitcher], [class@Adw.ViewSwitcherBar] and
[class@Adw.ViewSwitcherTitle] now use [class@Adw.ViewStack] instead of
[class@Gtk.Stack].

You should stop using [property@Gtk.Stack:transition-type] and
[property@Gtk.Stack:transition-duration] properties before switching to
[class@Adw.ViewStack].

### Adapt to Stylesheet Changes

The public colors `@theme_selected_bg_color` and `@theme_selected_fg_color` have
been renamed to `@accent_bg_color` and `@accent_fg_color`.

If you were using `@theme_selected_bg_color` as a text color, use
`@accent_color` instead to make sure the text is readable. You can also use the
`.accent` style class to apply the correct color.

## Migrating from alpha 2 to alpha 3

### Stop Using `AdwValueObject` with non-string values

`AdwValueObject` has been removed. The typical use for storing strings in
combination with [class@Gio.ListStore] can be replaced by using
[class@Gtk.StringList], others cases can be replaced by creating your own
objects to store those values .

### Adapt to `AdwEnumValueObject` API Changes

`AdwEnumValueObject` has been renamed to [class@Adw.EnumListItem].

### Adapt to window API changes

The `child` property in [class@Adw.Window] and [class@Adw.ApplicationWindow] has
been renamed to `content`.

### Adapt to [class@Adw.Leaflet] API changes

The `hhomogeneous-folded`, `vhomogeneous-folded`, `hhomogeneous-unfolded`,
and `vhomogeneous-unfolded` properties have been replaced by a single
[property@Adw.Leaflet:homogeneous] property, set to `TRUE` by default,
applied when the leaflet is folded for the opposite orientation.

When unfolded, children are never homogeneous. Use [class@Gtk.SizeGroup]
to make them homogeneous if needed.

The `interpolate-size` property has been removed with no replacement, it's
always enabled when [property@Adw.Leaflet:homogeneous] is set to `FALSE`.

### Adapt to view switcher API changes

The `auto` view switcher policy has been removed. [class@Adw.ViewSwitcher] only
has narrow and wide policies; if you had used the `auto` policy, use an
[class@Adw.Squeezer] with two view switchers inside.

#### Adapt to [class@Adw.ViewSwitcher] API Changes

The "narrow-ellipsize" property has been removed. Narrow view switchers always
ellipsize their labels, wide switchers never do.

#### Adapt to [class@Adw.ViewSwitcherBar] API Changes

The "policy" property has been removed. If you had used it, use a plain
[class@Adw.ViewSwitcher] in a [class@Gtk.ActionBar] instead.

#### Adapt to [class@Adw.ViewSwitcherTitle] API Changes

The "policy" property has been removed, the behavior is similar to the removed
`auto` policy. If you had used `wide` or `narrow` policies, use an
[class@Adw.Squeezer] with an [class@Adw.ViewSwitcher] and an
[class@Adw.WindowTitle] inside, with the switcher having the desired policy.

### Adapt to [class@Adw.Avatar] API Changes

The `adw_avatar_draw_to_pixbuf()` function have been removed, use the newly
added [method@Adw.Avatar.draw_to_texture] instead. [class@Gdk.Texture]
implements [iface@Gio.Icon], so it should just work for that case.

[method@Adw.Avatar.draw_to_texture] does not have the `size` parameter. Instead,
it uses the avatar's current size, with no replacement.

### Use [class@Adw.StyleManager] instead of [property@Gtk.Settings:gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme]

Using [property@Gtk.Settings:gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme] to control dark
appearance is not supported anymore, set [property@Adw.StyleManager:color-scheme]
to `ADW_COLOR_SCHEME_PREFER_DARK` and make sure the application can work with
light appearance as well. If that's not possible, set it to or
`ADW_COLOR_SCHEME_FORCE_DARK` instead.

If your application is using light appearance, make sure it works wit dark
appearance as well, or set the color scheme to `ADW_COLOR_SCHEME_FORCE_LIGHT`
otherwise.

### Adapt to Stylesheet Changes

#### Adapt to Header Bar, Action Bar and Toolbar Style Changes

When possible, buttons in [class@Gtk.HeaderBar] and [class@Gtk.ActionBar] will
use flat appearance by default.

The following rules are used when deciding when to make buttons flat or not:

The following buttons get flat appearance:

* Icon-only buttons;
* Buttons with an icon and a label (using [class@Adw.ButtonContent]);
* Menu buttons containing an arrow;
* [class@Adw.SplitButton];
* Any other button with the `.flat` style class.

The following buttons keep default appearance:

* Text-only buttons;
* Buttons with other content;
* Buttons within widgets containing the `.linked` style class;
* Buttons with the `.suggested-action` or `.destructive-action` style classes.
* Buttons with the `.raised` style class.

It's important to avoid ambiguous layouts, for example text-only buttons with
no icon, since such a button would be indistinguishable from the window title
without hovering it.

In rare cases, the existing layout may need a redesign to work with the new
style.

The same rules are also used for the `.toolbar` style class now, instead of
making every button appear flat.

#### Adjusting Icon+Arrow Menu Buttons

If you had menu buttons containing an icon and a dropdown arrow, switch to
[property@Gtk.MenuButton:icon-name] and set the
[property@Gtk.MenuButton:always-show-arrow] property to `TRUE`.

#### Adjusting Text-only Buttons

If you had text-only buttons, consider using [class@Adw.ButtonContent]. For
example, the following button:

```xml
<object class="GtkButton">
  <property name="label" translatable="yes">_Open</property>
  <property name="use-underline">True</property>
</object>
```

can be changed into:

```xml
<object class="GtkButton">
  <property name="child">
    <object class="AdwButtonContent">
      <property name="icon-name">document-open-symbolic</property>
      <property name="label" translatable="yes">_Open</property>
      <property name="use-underline">True</property>
    </object>
  </property>
</object>
```

One exception are the two primary buttons in a dialog, for example, "Cancel" and
"Open". Those buttons should retain their default appearance.

#### Adjusting Split Buttons

If you had split buttons implemented via a `GtkBox` with the `.linked` style
class and two buttons packed inside, use `AdwSplitButton` as follows:

```xml
<object class="AdwSplitButton">
  <property name="menu-model">some_menu</property>
  <property name="icon-name">view-list-symbolic</property>
</object>
```

#### Adjusting Linked Buttons

For other linked together buttons, simply stop linking them.

If multiple linked groups were used to separate different groups of actions,
insert extra spacing as follows:

```xml
<object class="GtkSeparator">
  <style>
    <class name="spacer"/>
  </style>
</object>
```

#### Custom adjustments

The `.flat` and `.raised` style classes can always be used to override the
default appearance.

Important: the [property@Gtk.Button:has-frame] property will **not** be set to
`FALSE` when a button gets the flat appearance automatically. It also cannot be
set to `TRUE` to make a button raised, the style class should be used directly
instead.

## Migrating from alpha 3 to alpha 4

### Adapt to [class@Adw.ActionRow] and [class@Adw.ExpanderRow] API Changes

The "use-underline" property and its accessors have been removed. Use
[property@Adw.PreferencesRow:use-underline] and its accessors instead.

The title and subtitle have markup enabled, make sure to escape it with
[func@GLib.markup_escape_text] if this is unwanted.

### Adapt to [class@Adw.ExpanderRow] API Changes

The `adw_expander_row_add ()` function has been renamed to `adw_expander_row_add_row ()`.

### Adjusting Header Bar Icons

If you're using the `object-select-symbolic` icon in a header bar button
(typically for selection mode), use `selection-mode-symbolic` instead.

### Adapt to Stylesheet Changes

### Stop using the `.sidebar` style class

The `.sidebar` style class is now deprecated, although still works for
compatibility reasons. The main use case - adjusting the background color of
[class@Gtk.ListBox] and [class@Gtk.ListView] - can now be done with the
`.navigation-sidebar` style class on those widgets instead, along with adjusting
the item selection style. The border can be replicated by manually adding a
[class@Gtk.Separator].

#### Adapt to the `popover.combo` style removal

The `.combo` popover style class has been removed. Use `.menu` instead. You may
need to remove manually added margins, padding or minimum height from the list
items inside while doing it.

#### Adapt to List Style Changes

For boxed lists we now have the `.boxed-list` style class that matches
the name of the design pattern. If you were using the `.content` style
class, you should use `.boxed-list` instead.

The `.content` style class currently remains for compatibility purposes.
