# Manual Tests

These tests can be manually built and ran. Add examples and test cases that are
too niche for the demo here.

When using Builder, use "Select Run Commandâ€¦" to select an run a test instead of
the demo.

Otherwise, run them manually from build directory, e.g.:

```sh
cd build
./tests/manual/test-button-states
```
