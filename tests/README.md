# Standalone Tests

These tests can be manually built and ran. Add examples and test cases that are
too niche for the demo here.

When using Builder, use "Select Run Command…" to select an run a test instead of
the demo.

Otherwise, run them manually from build directory, e.g.:

```sh
cd build
./tests/test-button-states
```

Not to be confused with unit tests, those are in the `testsuite/` directory.
